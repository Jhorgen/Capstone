 Boosted performance calculator

Select a vehicle by its year, make, and model. Then select a turbocharger to receive performance statistics based on your selection.

This application allows you to plan ahead and take out some of the guess work that goes into modifying a vehicle.

Results will be calculated by:
 - Horsepower (Stock)
 - Turbocharger size (CFM)
 - Boost pressure (PSI)

Returns:
 - Estimated horsepower (additional & total)
 - Estimated torque (additional & total)
 - CFM (Air flow produced by the turbocharger)
 - More to come

 Additional features & stretch goals

Based on engine internals:
 - Recommends safe power level.
 - Alerts the user if power level is unsafe without further modification.
 - Recommends a solution to sustain higher power levels.
